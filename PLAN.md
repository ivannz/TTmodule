Planned
-------

[ ] Implement algorithm 1 from [Tensor Ring Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05535) in as similar fashion as TT-svd `tensor_to_tt()` in `.tensor`.

[ ] Move the tr-vec product code, the one with dim-roll into `.tensor`
* take formulae from section 4 and figure out a more efficient tr-vec product
* tr-matrix format?
